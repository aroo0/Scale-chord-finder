# SCALE CHORD FINDER

Scale Chord Finder is a command-line program that helps users find a given chord in minor and major scales, as well as determine the function of a chord in a given scale by specifying its number.


## Features

The program uses a tree and circular list data structure, as well as a breadth-first search (BFS) tree searching algorithm. These are utilized in two main ways:

1. To create scales and chords, and
2. To hold them in the tree structure in order to search for them in an efficient way during conversation.

## How to Use
To use Scale Chord Finder, simply clone the repository and run the `program.py` file in your preferred command-line interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the desired chord or scale and find the corresponding results.
